Task 3: Largest Palindrome

Given a string S consisting  of digits, find the largest palindromic number that can be created using digits from S.

Task description

You are given a string S, which consists entirely of decimal digits (0−9). Using digits from S,
create a palindromic number with the largest possibledecimal value. You should use at least
one digit and you can reorder the digits. A palindromic number remains the same when its
digits are reversed;for instance, "7", "44" or "83238". Any palindromic number you create
should not, however, have any leading zeros, such as in "0990" or "010".
For example, decimal palindromic numbers that can be created from "8199" are: "1", "8",
"9", "99", "919" and "989". Among them, “989” has the largest value.

Write a function:

class Solution { public String solution(String S); }
that, given a string S of N digits, returns the string representing the palindromic number with
the largest value.
Examples:
1. Given "39878", your function should return "898".
2. Given "00900", your function should return "9".
3. Given "0000", your function should return "0".
4. Given "54321", your function should return "5".
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
string S is made only of digits (0−9).
